    "description": "Technologist and TED Fellow Gautam Shah invites us to imagine how the metaverse could redefine the relationships between humans and other species. By giving individual wild animals a personal identity (such as Fio, a young orangutan in Borneo, or Mweituria, an elephant living in Kenya) and sharing data on their migration, milestones and habitats, Shah thinks we could empathize with wildlife in a whole new way. Learn more about how emerging technology could bring us closer to the natural world -- and what the connections we build there could mean for the future of the planet.",

    "description": "If we want to better understand the environment and combat climate change, we need to look deep underground, where diverse microscopic fungal networks mingle with tree roots to form symbiotic partnerships, says microbiologist Colin Averill. As we learn more about which of these fungi are most beneficial to forest health, we can reintroduce them into the soil -- potentially enhancing the growth and resilience of carbon-trapping trees and plants. Hear more about the emerging science aiming to supercharge forest ecosystems, one handful of soil at a time.",

    "description": "One billion people worldwide are living with a disability, and too many of them are left unemployed or feeling like they need to hide their conditions due to discriminatory hiring practices, says social innovator and TED Fellow Ryan Gersava. With a focus on healing and disclosure, he created an online school to provide people like him with the technical skills and employment aid they need to thrive. Now he's calling for every company to initiate efforts to welcome and support those with disabilities, creating a future of work that leaves no one behind.",

    "description": "As the child of Holocaust survivors and a World War II refugee herself, peace builder Georgette Bennett was stunned by the human toll and tragedy of the Syrian civil war. She got to work, bringing together historical enemies to build an aid pipeline from Israel to Syria -- a feat many considered impossible, but has since helped millions. Through this inspiring story of unlikely partnership, Bennett shares three steps for creating change and invites all of us to take action when we see someone in need.",

Through a kaleidoscopic blend of technology, nature and art, neural artist Sofia Crespo brings to life animals that push the boundaries of creativity and imagination. Her artistic renditions of chimeras combine images of real-world endangered species to create something totally new -- with the intention of inspiring real-world conservation. Witness a speculative study of creatures that never existed, brought to life by AI.",

    "description": "Our memories and bodies give us clues about who we are, but what happens when this guidance shifts? In this mind-bending talk, science writer Anil Ananthaswamy shares how the experiences of \"altered selves\" -- resulting from schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, foreign limb syndrome or other conditions -- shed light on the constructed nature of identity. He breaks down where our sense of self comes from and invites us to challenge our assumptions about who we are, with the aim of building a better you and a better world.",

That's the kind of machine that TED Fellow Robert Katzschmann's lab builds: soft-bodied robots that imitate natural movements with artificial, silent muscles. He lays out his vision for machines that take on mesmerizing new forms, made of softer and more lifelike materials -- and capable of discovering unknown parts of the world.",

    "description": "Can we use less energy from fossil fuels while also meeting our transportation needs? Enter shared electric micromobility: the transition away from dependence on cars and towards lightweight transport options like electric scooters, which release a fraction of the carbon emissions of conventional transport. Helping people get around on the world's largest shared electric vehicles system, entrepreneur and Lime CEO Wayne Ting shares how his company redesigned their scooters so parts can be reused and recycled, ultimately reducing their direct and indirect carbon output. \"We have to work at building a future of transportation that is shared, affordable, but most importantly, carbon-free,\" he says.",

    "description": "We know capitalism exacerbates injustice and inequality worldwide. So how can we fix it? Professor and social entrepreneur Manish Bhardwaj thinks we need to integrate \"moral clarity\" -- which he defines as \"doing the right thing because it is right, and not from fear of sanction or in expectation of reward\" -- into society at a foundational level. In this practical talk, he explains how to use the language of moral clarity as a compass for organizations, communities and our personal lives -- and how it could help create a more just world.",

    "description": "Confronting climate change makes for better cities and a better quality of life, says Heidi Sørensen, director of the climate agency for the city of Oslo, Norway. From construction sites without noise pollution to fully electric transportation, she details the exciting green transition happening in her city. The Norwegian capital's ambitious goal of reducing 95 percent of its carbon emissions by 2030 is driven by a unique policy approach: a world-first carbon budget, which works side by side with the financial budget and clearly states what needs to be done, by whom and when for the city to reach its climate goals. She shares five crucial lessons Oslo has learned along the way to creating a better city for everyone -- and what it could mean for the rest of the world.",

Chris Roe, Amazon's director of energy and sustainable operations, shares the company's pledge to get to net-zero carbon and fully operate all buildings -- including data and distribution centers, warehouses, commercial offices and grocery stores -- on 100-percent renewable energy. He reveals the most critical part of achieving these goals: partnering with companies around the globe to spearhead new wind and solar projects. Modeling a collaborative approach to a climate-friendly future, Roe invites leaders and companies everywhere to set their ambitions high and create a world that runs on green energy -- because we can only achieve this together.",

Working to make this 400-billion-dollar-a-year supply chain process as efficient and sustainable as possible, freight expert Oren Zaslansky digs into the logistics of filling these trucks to their maximum capacity through algorithmic carpooling (think: ride-sharing your freight) -- bringing with it the potential of a more transparent and eco-friendly global supply chain.",

To help manage it, doctors often prescribe powerful opioids -- but they're not always the best option and can quickly lead to addiction. Illuminating the fine line between substance use and abuse, Dr. Jen Gunter explains what opioids do to your perception of pain, the risks they pose and the questions to ask your doctor about them.

    "description": "Pakistan contributes less than one percent to the global greenhouse gas emissions perpetrating climate change, yet one-third of the country was recently inundated with \"biblical\" floods that killed hundreds and displaced millions. If we're to move towards a sustainable future in the wake of such tragedies, the response will require more than just infrastructure repairs and a return to the status quo, says columnist Huma Yusuf. She shares a vision for global climate diplomacy where the countries responsible for pollution pay reparations for the damage they've caused, while developing countries bring forward a clean, green future. (Followed by a Q&A with TED Global Curator Bruno Giussani)",

    "description": "In June 2022, TED's climate initiative, Countdown, launched its Dilemma Series: events designed to look at some of the \"knots\" in the climate change space, where diverging positions have stalled progress and solidified into an inability to collaborate across differences. The event focused on the question: Is there a role for carbon credits in the transition to a fair, net-zero future? Through TED Talks and conversations featuring scientists, CEOs, activists, politicians, artists, frontline community leaders, investors and more, this film offers a 360-degree view of carbon credits -- a contentious subject that prompted some discomfort, disagreement and, ultimately, a renewed sense of possibility. It's an invitation to listen deeply, keep an open mind and get a little wiser on a complex topic. (Featuring, in order of appearance: Tamara Toles O'Laughlin, John Kilani, Nat Keohane, Julio Friedmann, Donnel Baird, Nili Gilbert, Al Gore, Inés Yábar, James Dyke, Tom Rivett-Carnac, Lindsay Levin, David Biello, Gilles Dufrasne, Kavita Prakash-Mani, Susan Chomba, Gabrielle Walker, Derik Broekhoff, Annette Nazareth)",

It's time for leaders to become \"rock stars\" of inclusion -- and that starts with pushing through discomfort to forge new connections, says veteran broadcaster and diversity leader June Sarpong. She presents examples of successful, creative DEI efforts and calls for leaders at the top to make the first move. \"When it comes to diversity and inclusion, we need bold disruptors who are uncomfortable with the status quo, even if the status quo benefits them,\" Sarpong says.",

Dr. Jen Gunter explains how our ability to smell and taste work together to give us a full sensory experience. So whether you're sniffing the caramelized aroma of coffee, a whiff of trash or a trillion other things, your brain knows exactly what's under your nose.

Instead of imposing pre-designed policy and plans on local people, she says, conservation efforts should center those who know the land best, enabling them to tailor solutions to their unique environmental, social and economic realities. She presents a roadmap for Indigenous communities to take back ownership of their heritage and reclaim stewardship of their land. \"Real community-based conservation ... fosters fierce independence,\" Costa says.",

    "description": "After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru. But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness meditation, and how it can boost your resiliency, quiet your inner critic and simply make you more pleasant to be around.",

Inviting you to reconsider your connection to dance, he shows how even everyday experiences -- tying your shoes, rocking a baby, whisking up some mac and cheese -- can offer choreographic inspiration and help you find joy and release when you need it most. After the talk, dancers Nico Lonetree and Ryan Spencer perform a dazzling routine infused with the humor and beauty of daily movements.",

Breaking down the crude tactics law enforcement uses to sweep up massive amounts of data collected about us by our everyday tech, he lays out how new legal firewalls can protect the public from geofence warrants and other surveillance abuses -- and how we might end the looming dystopia of mass surveillance.",

The result is that the brightest minds are convinced that \"success\" means leaving town. Urban revitalizer Majora Carter has a solution: What if we treated these communities like struggling companies? She presents a restorative economic approach to capitalism, which seeks to retain talent, build resilient communities and prove that you don't have to move out of your neighborhood to live in a better one.",

Journalist Katherine Mangu-Ward makes the case that \"weirdos\" left alone to innovate and explore far-out ideas in a free market system are our best hope for the future. She asks us to reconsider our qualms about capitalism, failure and corporate death, analyzing the recent history of General Motors and Facebook to illustrate why we're better off with a lot less government intervention.",
