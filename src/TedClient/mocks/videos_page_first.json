He shows how we could get there by ditching capitalism as the world's economic operating system and adopting \"universal basic services,\" where governments would freely provide life essentials like housing, health care, education and transport.

In this mind-bending talk, science writer Anil Ananthaswamy shares how the experiences of \"altered selves\" -- resulting from schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, foreign limb syndrome or other conditions -- shed light on the constructed nature of identity. He breaks down where our sense of self comes from and invites us to challenge our assumptions about who we are, with the aim of building a better you and a better world.",

As we learn more about which of these fungi are most beneficial to forest health, we can reintroduce them into the soil -- potentially enhancing the growth and resilience of carbon-trapping trees and plants. Hear more about the emerging science aiming to supercharge forest ecosystems, one handful of soil at a time.",
